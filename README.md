# Product Designer Portfolio

## Hello There üëãüèΩ
Hello, I'm Asia, a multidisciplinary product designer with 15+ years of experience. I team up with mission-driven startups, small businesses, enterprises, and non-profits alike to craft delightful, inclusive, and accessible digital experiences. Using skills across the UX Design, User Research, and Front-End Web Development disciplines, I've helped launch websites, mobile apps, and design systems.

When I'm not designing, I am an avid gamer, reader, and writer who never stops learning.

This repository will serve as the new codebase for my portfolio.
